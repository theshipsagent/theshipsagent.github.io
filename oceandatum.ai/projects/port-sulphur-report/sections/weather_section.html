  <div class="content-block">
    <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
    <p>
      Port Sulphur Terminal operates at Mississippi River Mile 48.6 AHP within a remarkably consistent annual hydrologic cycle, shaped by three distinct seasonal patterns. The location experiences extreme variations in river discharge (131,000 to 650,000+ CFS), water velocity (1.2 to 5.0+ fps), and compound flooding risks from storm surge, river stage, and precipitation. However, post-Katrina levee improvements provide 100-year level protection, and the terminal's deep-water access creates strategic advantages during extreme low-water events.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Critical operational finding:</strong> The prime construction window (July-September) overlaps with peak hurricane season, requiring flexible scheduling and enhanced monitoring protocols. Winter low-water periods (November-February) offer ideal conditions for underwater work and maintenance, while spring high-water events (March-June) present the most challenging conditions with extreme current velocities.

  <div class="content-block">
    <h3>Historical Flood Events & Infrastructure Resilience</h3>
    <p>
      Port Sulphur has experienced both catastrophic storm surge events and extreme river flooding, providing a comprehensive dataset for design envelope development. The 2005 Hurricane Katrina event with ~22 feet of inundation at Port Sulphur led to significant federal levee improvements under the HSDRRS (Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction System), which have been successfully validated during subsequent hurricanes Isaac (2012) and Ida (2021).

  <!-- Compound Flooding Risks -->
  <div class="content-block">
    <h3>Compound Flooding Scenarios</h3>
    <p>
      Port Sulphur faces unique compound flooding risks from the simultaneous interaction of multiple water sources. A tropical system can produce:
    </p>
    <ul class="detailed-list">
      <li><strong>Storm surge from Gulf of Mexico:</strong> 8-22+ feet depending on storm characteristics</li>
      <li><strong>Mississippi River stage elevation:</strong> Can coincide with spring high water (March-June)</li>
      <li><strong>Tropical rainfall:</strong> 5-15 inches over multi-day periods</li>
      <li><strong>Timing interactions:</strong> When these factors align, regional flooding extends beyond immediate storm areas</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The 2019 extended spring flood event (>6 months sustained high water) coinciding with active hurricane season provided valuable data on infrastructure performance under compound stress scenarios. Federal levee protection has proven effective, but operational planning must account for these multi-factor risk periods.

  <!-- Hurricane Season Analysis -->
  <div class="content-block">
    <h3>Hurricane Season Risk Management</h3>
    <p>
      Port Sulphur lies in the primary threat zone for Gulf of Mexico tropical systems, with hurricane season running June 1 - November 30 and peak activity during August-October. This creates a critical operational planning challenge: the prime construction window (July-September) overlaps directly with elevated hurricane risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Risk mitigation strategies:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul class="detailed-list">
      <li><strong>5-day advance forecasts:</strong> National Hurricane Center provides sufficient warning for preparation</li>
      <li><strong>Flexible scheduling:</strong> Construction projects must accommodate weather-related pauses</li>
      <li><strong>Enhanced monitoring:</strong> Peak season (August-October) requires continuous weather surveillance</li>
      <li><strong>Infrastructure protection:</strong> Federal HSDRRS levee system provides 100-year level protection</li>
      <li><strong>Historical validation:</strong> Post-Katrina improvements successfully tested during Isaac (2012) and Ida (2021)</li>

  <!-- Weather Patterns Detail -->
  <div class="content-block">
    <h3>Detailed Weather Patterns</h3>

    <h4>Precipitation (62-65 inches annually)</h4>
    <p>
      Unevenly distributed throughout the year with distinct seasonal patterns:
    </p>
    <ul class="detailed-list">
      <li><strong>Summer (June-September):</strong> Intense convective activity with several inches possible in short time periods, peak intensity during late afternoon/evening hours</li>
      <li><strong>Winter (December-February):</strong> Longer-duration, lower-intensity systems with minimal but persistent impact</li>
      <li><strong>Tropical events:</strong> 5-15 inches over multi-day periods, often coinciding with elevated river stages</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Wind Conditions</h4>
    <p><strong>Summer:</strong> South winds 5-10 knots typical, 1-2 foot seas in coastal approaches, thunderstorm activity creates variable conditions</p>
    <p><strong>Winter:</strong> More variable wind directions; cold fronts bring sustained winds 30-40 mph with higher gusts for 24-48 hour durations, challenging vessel operations and potentially requiring temporary suspension of cargo handling</p>
    <p><strong>Hurricane season:</strong> June 1 - November 30, most significant weather-related operational risk with 5-day advance forecasts available</p>

    <h4>Fog Conditions (15-25 days annually)</h4>
    <ul class="detailed-list">
      <li><strong>Peak period:</strong> December - March (winter season)</li>
      <li><strong>Formation mechanism:</strong> Radiational cooling combined with river surface moisture</li>
      <li><strong>Typical duration:</strong> Early morning through mid-morning; occasionally all-day events</li>
      <li><strong>Visibility threshold:</strong> Dense fog <0.25 miles requires vessel movement suspension</li>
      <li><strong>Economic impact:</strong> Navigation restrictions and cargo handling limitations accumulate over fog season</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Strategic Advantages -->
  <div class="content-block">
    <h3>Competitive Advantages & Strategic Positioning</h3>

    <h4>Deep-Water Access</h4>
    <p>
      The terminal's deep-water capability provides significant competitive advantages during extreme low-water periods when shallow terminals face draft restrictions. The 2023 extreme low water event (131,000 CFS) demonstrated this strategic positioning, creating revenue opportunities while competitors experienced operational constraints.
    </p>

    <h4>Federal Levee Protection</h4>
    <p>
      Location within the HSDRRS (Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction System) provides 100-year level of risk reduction (1% annual exceedance probability). This protection has been validated through major storms including Hurricane Isaac (2012) and Hurricane Ida (2021), with visible water lines on levees confirming system effectiveness.
    </p>

    <h4>Year-Round Operational Capability</h4>
    <p>
      Unlike many terminals that face significant seasonal constraints, Port Sulphur maintains operational capability across the full range of river conditions through seasonal optimization:
    </p>
    <ul class="detailed-list">
      <li><strong>Spring high water (Mar-Jun):</strong> Maximum draft capability despite challenging currents</li>
      <li><strong>Summer/fall transition (Jul-Oct):</strong> Optimal operations and construction windows</li>
      <li><strong>Winter low water (Nov-Feb):</strong> Competitive advantage for deep-water access, ideal for maintenance</li>

        <strong>Leverage Winter Low-Water Windows:</strong> Schedule underwater inspections, maintenance, and precision work for November-February when current velocities are minimal (1.2-1.8 fps). Enhanced safety protocols for fog and cold front events required.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Enhance Hurricane Monitoring:</strong> Implement comprehensive weather surveillance during peak season (August-October). Utilize NHC 5-day forecasts for advance preparation and vessel/construction activity planning.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Capitalize on Deep-Water Advantage:</strong> Market year-round operational capability, particularly during extreme low-water periods when competitors face draft restrictions. 2023 event validated this competitive positioning.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Maintain Spring High-Water Readiness:</strong> Enhanced tug assistance and specialized mooring procedures for March-June period. Accept construction constraints but leverage maximum draft capability for vessel operations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Compound Flooding Risk Management:</strong> Monitor combined risks during tropical season overlapping with elevated river stages. Federal HSDRRS protection provides robust defense, but operational awareness of multi-factor scenarios is critical.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Long-term Climate Adaptation:</strong> Integrate climate considerations into infrastructure planning: sea level rise, subsidence monitoring, potential changes in storm intensity/frequency, and watershed-scale hydrologic shifts. Federal levee system incorporates adaptive design standards.
