    <h3>2. 20 mph Speed Limit Throughout NORG</h3>
    <ul class="feature-list">
      <li>The 20 mph restriction applies to the entire 29-mile NORG corridor — not just the bridge — due to track condition, curve geometry, and urban grade crossing density</li>
      <li>Class I mainline standards typically allow 40–79 mph for freight trains; the NORG speed limit is less than half the minimum mainline standard</li>
      <li>A single freight train traversing the full NORG corridor requires approximately 87 minutes at 20 mph, vs. ~22 minutes at a standard 79 mph freight speed — a 4x time penalty</li>
      <li>The speed restriction is particularly damaging to Amtrak passenger service, which competes with the same track as freight and cannot achieve scheduled times without infrastructure improvements</li>

    <h3>5. At-Grade Crossings (20 in NORG)</h3>
    <p>The 20 at-grade highway-rail crossings within the NORG corridor generate 112.4 hours per day of vehicle delay — the cumulative time that motor vehicles are stopped at crossing gates waiting for trains. This vehicular delay has a direct economic cost in lost productivity, fuel waste, and emergency vehicle access impairment. It also creates safety risk: at-grade crossings are the site of the vast majority of highway-rail fatalities in the US.</p>

  <!-- Proposed Passenger Rail Impact -->

    <h2>Proposed Baton Rouge–New Orleans Passenger Rail Impact</h2>
    <p>Louisiana has proposed restoring passenger rail service between Baton Rouge and New Orleans along the existing CN Illinois Central corridor and the NORG right-of-way. While the route has strong political and economic support, its implementation on shared infrastructure creates a significant capacity conflict with existing freight operations in an already-constrained corridor.</p>
    <div class="alert-box">
      <p><strong>Capacity Conflict — Proposed Baton Rouge–NOLA Passenger Rail</strong></p>
      <ul class="feature-list">
        <li><strong>CPKC bridge at Plaquemines:</strong> Proposed passenger rail routing would need to cross or avoid the new CPKC rail bridge at Plaquemines, creating routing challenges at the southern end of the corridor</li>
        <li><strong>EBJ flyover conflict:</strong> The proposed East Bank Junction (EBJ) flyover grade separation, designed to relieve freight conflicts, would need to accommodate passenger rail geometry and platform height requirements — adding cost and design complexity</li>
        <li><strong>Mixed-use conflict:</strong> Adding 4–8 daily passenger trains to the NORG corridor (which already operates at 40 trains/day near capacity) would require either new track construction or displacement of freight trains — both expensive options</li>
        <li><strong>Capital cost:</strong> Estimated infrastructure cost for Baton Rouge–NOLA passenger rail implementation: <strong>$262 million</strong> (state estimate; independent estimates range higher)</li>
        <li><strong>Operating subsidy:</strong> Annual operating subsidy projected at <strong>$6.7 million per year</strong> — requires dedicated state funding stream; no funding mechanism established as of February 2026</li>

  <!-- Belt Alternatives -->
  <div class="glass-section">
    <h2>Belt Alternatives (Historical Studies)</h2>

    <h3>Front Belt — Rejected</h3>
    <p>The "Front Belt" alignment studied in earlier decades would have routed freight rail along the riverfront, parallel to the Mississippi River levee, through the central business district. This alignment was ultimately rejected because of the extreme density of urban development along the riverfront, the high cost of right-of-way acquisition, and the incompatibility with Port NOLA's cargo handling operations on the batture. The Front Belt concept has not been actively studied since the 1980s and is not considered viable under current land use conditions.</p>

    <h3>Back Belt — Current</h3>
    <p>The current NORG corridor represents the de facto "Back Belt" — a routing that arcs through interior neighborhoods rather than along the riverfront. The Back Belt alignment was established in the railroad era of the early 20th century and reflects the land availability and property values of that period. Today, dense residential and commercial development surrounds the Back Belt corridor, making capacity expansion (additional tracks, grade separations) extremely expensive due to right-of-way acquisition costs and community impact concerns. Nonetheless, the Back Belt is the only operational rail corridor through New Orleans, and all infrastructure improvements in the current pipeline are along this alignment.</p>

    <h3>Middle Belt / Carrollton Curve — Preferred by Some Studies</h3>
    <p>Several infrastructure studies from the 2000s and 2010s identified a "Middle Belt" alignment via the Carrollton Curve as potentially superior for long-term capacity expansion. This alignment would utilize an existing but underused rail right-of-way through the Carrollton neighborhood to provide a more direct east-west connection, potentially bypassing the most congested segment of the Back Belt near the central business district. However, community opposition to rail expansion through residential Carrollton, combined with the capital cost of new infrastructure on any new alignment, has kept the Middle Belt as a conceptual study rather than a funded project. As of February 2026, all active investment is focused on improving the existing Back Belt / NORG corridor.</p>

  <!-- Operational Challenges -->
  <div class="glass-section">
    <h2>Operational Challenges</h2>

    <h3>Switching Delays &amp; Terminal Dwell</h3>
    <p>Rail NOLA switching operations are constrained by the limited capacity of France Yard (435 cars) and Claiborne Yard (335 cars) relative to the volume of interchange traffic passing through the gateway. When either yard reaches capacity — which occurs routinely during peak periods — incoming trains must hold on the main line, fouling the NORG corridor and generating the 29.7 hours/day of aggregate delay observed in operational studies. The switching delay problem is compounded by the single-track Huey P. Long Bridge, which creates a queuing bottleneck for all east-west movements and means that delays on one side of the river propagate to the other side.</p>

    <h3>Flood Gates &amp; Storm Closures</h3>
    <p>New Orleans' flood protection infrastructure — the levee system, flood walls, and IHNC surge gates — intersects with the rail network at multiple points. Following Hurricane Katrina and subsequent USACE infrastructure improvements, flood gates have been installed at locations where rail corridors penetrate the levee system. These gates must be closed during hurricane events, which shuts down rail service through the affected segments. Hurricane evacuation protocols also require clearing the rail network of rolling stock before storm landfall, creating service disruptions in the 48–72 hours before and after major storm events — a recurring operational challenge in a region with an active hurricane season.</p>

    <h3>Congestion Impacts on Terminal Operations</h3>
    <p>The NORG corridor's congestion has measurable effects on terminal dwell times throughout the gateway. Average car dwell at NOLA gateway terminals — the time a rail car sits in a yard between arrival and departure — is approximately 18–24 hours, compared to a national average of 12–16 hours for similar terminal operations. This extended dwell reflects both the switching capacity constraints within the yards and the main-line queuing that prevents timely car pickup by road trains. Extended dwell is costly: it ties up car supply, reduces fleet velocity, and makes NOLA a less attractive gateway for time-sensitive intermodal shipments relative to competing Gulf Coast ports with better rail connectivity.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Competitive Implications -->
  <div class="glass-section">
    <h2>Competitive Implications</h2>
    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p><strong>Gateway Congestion &amp; Competitive Position</strong></p>
      <ul class="feature-list">
        <li><strong>Traffic diversion to competing gateways:</strong> Shippers and ocean carriers with flexibility to choose between Gulf Coast ports increasingly favor Houston (Barbours Cut/Bayport), Mobile (APM/MDT), or even Savannah/Charleston over New Orleans when transit time reliability is a priority — NORG congestion directly erodes Port NOLA's competitive position</li>
        <li><strong>LIT disadvantage before opening:</strong> The Louisiana International Terminal's business case assumes competitive on-dock rail service times; if the Almonaster Bridge and Huey P. Long bottlenecks are not resolved concurrent with LIT's opening, LIT will be operationally disadvantaged from day one against competitor terminals with better rail access</li>
        <li><strong>Truck competition strengthened:</strong> For shorter-haul moves (under 300 miles), truck already competes effectively with rail. Extended rail dwell times and service unreliability at NOLA push some shippers permanently to truck — a market share loss that is difficult to recover even after infrastructure improvements</li>
        <li><strong>Port market share at risk:</strong> USDOT freight forecasts projecting doubled Gulf Coast tonnage by 2030 represent an opportunity for Port NOLA — but only if infrastructure improvements keep pace. Without investment, the volume growth will route through competing ports with higher-capacity rail connectivity</li>
      </ul>

  </div>

  <!-- Funding Challenges -->
  <div class="glass-section">
    <h2>Funding Challenges</h2>
    <p>The $4.1B+ infrastructure pipeline identified for the NOLA gateway faces significant funding challenges. No single funding source can address the full pipeline, and the scale of investment required exceeds the historical annual capital commitment from all sources combined. The following funding mechanisms are available, each with constraints:</p>
    <ul class="feature-list">
      <li><strong>Federal grants (CRISI, RAISE, Port Infrastructure Development Program):</strong> The primary federal programs for rail and port infrastructure are competitive grants with annual appropriations well below the NOLA gateway's identified need. CRISI (Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements) awards have historically funded individual projects in the $5M–$50M range — far below the scale needed for bridge replacements or second crossings. The NOPB Gateway CRISI grant of $7.29M illustrates both the availability and the scale mismatch of federal grant funding.</li>
      <li><strong>State of Louisiana capital outlay and DOTD programs:</strong> Louisiana's infrastructure budget is constrained by the state's fiscal position; major rail infrastructure investment competes with highway, bridge, and coastal restoration priorities. The state has not established a dedicated rail infrastructure fund equivalent to programs in other rail-intensive states.</li>
      <li><strong>Class I railroad private investment:</strong> Class I railroads typically fund infrastructure that directly benefits their operations. CPKC's Plaquemines bridge is an example of private rail investment driven by direct commercial return. The second Mississippi River crossing and Oliver Yard freight lead extension would benefit multiple carriers but require multi-party cost sharing agreements that have historically been difficult to negotiate.</li>
      <li><strong>Public-private partnerships (P3):</strong> The LIT project is structured as a public-private partnership between Port NOLA and private terminal operators. P3 frameworks may be applicable to other gateway infrastructure, particularly the Almonaster Bridge replacement, but require careful structuring to align public access requirements with private investment returns.</li>
      <li><strong>Port NOLA revenues and bond financing:</strong> Port NOLA has bonding capacity tied to its revenue stream; capital investment decisions must balance gateway infrastructure needs against Port NOLA's own terminal development priorities (LIT, phase 2 development, etc.).</li>
    </ul>
