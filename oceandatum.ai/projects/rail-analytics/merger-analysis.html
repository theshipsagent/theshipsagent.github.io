    <p><strong>Merger Status Update — February 2026</strong></p>
    <p>Union Pacific announced its proposed acquisition of Norfolk Southern on <strong>December 16, 2025</strong>, valuing the transaction at approximately <strong>$85 billion</strong> (enterprise value including assumed NS debt). Union Pacific filed its application with the Surface Transportation Board (STB) as Docket No. <strong>FD 36838</strong> in late December 2025. On <strong>January 16, 2026</strong>, the STB issued a notice that the filing was <strong>incomplete</strong> and would require substantial supplemental information — including enhanced competitive impact analysis, shipper impact statements, and expanded employee transition plans — before the formal review clock would begin. A <strong>reverse termination fee of $2.5 billion</strong> has been disclosed in the transaction agreements. This would be the <strong>first Class I merger application reviewed under the STB's 2001 rules</strong>, which require that a major railroad merger "enhance" competition rather than merely not harm it — a significantly higher standard than the "public interest" test applied to prior mergers.</p>

  <!-- The 2-to-1 Problem -->
  <div class="glass-section">
    <h2>The 2-to-1 Problem at NOLA Gateway</h2>

    <h3>Historical Context: UP-SP Merger (1996)</h3>
    <p>The 1996 merger of Union Pacific and Southern Pacific created a precedent at the Gulf Coast that is directly relevant to the proposed UP-NS transaction. Prior to 1996, the West Bank of the New Orleans gateway was served by three independent carriers: UP, SP, and BNSF (then Burlington Northern Santa Fe). The UP-SP merger collapsed the West Bank from three competitors to two (UP-SP and BNSF), leaving shippers served exclusively by SP or UP with only one Class I option for certain corridors. The transition period in 1997–1998 was marked by severe service failures in the merged UP-SP network, prompting regulatory intervention.</p>
    <p>The critical lesson from 1996 is that the disappearance of one carrier at a multi-carrier gateway does not simply reduce competition by one-sixth — it eliminates an entire competitive alternative for any shipper whose freight cannot practically route via the remaining carriers. This is particularly acute where physical geography constrains interchange access, as it does at the New Orleans gateway.</p>

    <div class="alert-box">
      <p><strong>Key Insight: The Eastern Mirror of the Western Problem</strong></p>
      <p>The proposed UP-NS merger would do to the East Bank of the New Orleans gateway exactly what the 1996 UP-SP merger did to the West Bank: reduce a three-competitor market to a two-competitor market, with particular harm to shippers whose freight is physically constrained to NS-served facilities. The regulatory challenge is that the STB approved the West Bank reduction in 1996 under the lower "public interest" standard. Under the 2001 rules, UP must demonstrate the merger actively enhances competition — a burden that the East Bank geography makes extremely difficult to meet.</p>

  <!-- St. Bernard Corridor Captive Shipper Risk -->
  <div class="glass-section">
    <h2>St. Bernard Corridor Captive Shipper Risk</h2>

    <h3>Physical Geography</h3>
    <p>The St. Bernard Corridor in eastern New Orleans is bounded by the Mississippi River to the south and west, Lake Borgne to the east, and the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal (IHNC) to the west. This physical confinement means that industrial facilities in the St. Bernard Corridor have no practical rail access except through NS Oliver Yard — the only Class I classification facility with direct track into the corridor. CSX and CN service in the area depends on NOPB interchange, which adds switching cost and dwell time.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p><strong>Pre-Merger State</strong></p>
      <p>A cement terminal operator on the St. Bernard Corridor receiving imported clinker can today solicit competitive rate quotes from NS (direct service), CSX (via NOPB interchange at additional switching cost), and potentially CN for Chicago-origin moves. The existence of these alternatives — even at different cost levels — creates rate discipline that limits NS's pricing power to roughly the cost advantage of its direct service over competitors' NOPB-interchange costs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="alert-box">
      <p><strong>Post-Merger Captive Position</strong></p>
      <p>After the UP-NS merger, a cement terminal in the St. Bernard Corridor faces a fundamentally different competitive landscape. NS and UP are the same entity. The shipper's ability to threaten diversion to UP is eliminated because UP is now NS. The remaining alternatives — CSX via NOPB interchange and CN for Chicago moves — carry switching premiums that the merged UP-NS can comfortably undercut while still pricing well above competitive levels. The practical rate ceiling shifts from the competitive rate to the ceiling set by STB captive shipper rate reasonableness standards, which historically have been difficult and expensive for shippers to invoke.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Why This Is Worse Than Standard 2-to-1</h3>
    <p>Standard 2-to-1 competitive reduction analyses assume that the surviving competitor (CSX in this case) provides a meaningful check on the merged carrier's pricing. At the St. Bernard Corridor, CSX's access is structurally disadvantaged because it requires NOPB switching — an additional intermediate party, additional switching cost, and additional dwell time. In markets where time-sensitive deliveries or just-in-time supply chains are relevant, the effective competitive alternative is not CSX-via-NOPB but rather truck, which for heavy bulk commodities like cement is typically non-competitive on cost for distances above 250 miles.</p>
    <p>The second structural problem is the Louisiana International Terminal. LIT is being built adjacent to NS-served corridor specifically because NS Oliver Yard provides the on-dock rail access. If LIT becomes a major import container gateway, as Port NOLA intends, then the merged UP-NS would control both the primary Class I mainline access to LIT and the primary intermodal distribution network from LIT into the eastern US — creating a vertical integration concern that goes beyond standard captive shipper analysis.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- CGP Gaps & Limitations -->
  <div class="glass-section">
    <h2>Committed Gateway Pricing (CGP) — Gaps &amp; Limitations</h2>

    <h3>How CGP Works</h3>
    <ul class="feature-list">
      <li>CGP is an STB-mandated rate protection mechanism available at interchange gateways after a major merger</li>
      <li>At a CGP-eligible gateway, shippers can access rate commitments from the merged carrier based on pre-merger interline rates</li>
      <li>CGP applies only at <em>interchange gateways</em> — points where two railroads physically exchange traffic</li>
      <li>Shippers must affirmatively apply for CGP protection — it is not automatic</li>
      <li>CGP rates are subject to annual escalation and periodic renegotiation</li>
      <li>Certain commodity categories (including some agricultural and energy shipments) may be excluded from CGP eligibility</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="font-size:0.85rem;color:rgba(255,255,255,0.5);margin-top:0.5rem;"><em>Key Exclusion: CGP does not apply to single-line traffic — shipments that move entirely within one carrier's network. Post-merger, many movements that were previously NS single-line become UP-NS single-line with no CGP protection.</em></p>

    <h3>Critical Gap</h3>
    <div class="alert-box">
      <p><strong>The CGP Coverage Gap at St. Bernard Corridor</strong></p>
      <p>The St. Bernard Corridor shippers' core competitive situation is not an interchange gateway problem — it is a single-line origin problem. NS Oliver Yard is the origin point, and the competitive threat shippers use to discipline NS rates is the <em>existence of alternative carriers</em>, not the rate at an interchange gateway. CGP is designed to protect shippers at the interchange (e.g., New Orleans to Chicago via NS interchange with CSX at Knoxville) — but it provides zero protection for the primary competitive leverage: a shipper's ability to say "we will give this traffic to CSX instead of NS." Once NS and UP are the same entity, that threat evaporates, and no CGP provision restores it. This is why the merger poses a categorically different competitive harm at origin-point captive facilities compared to standard interchange gateway analysis.</p>

  <!-- Louisiana International Terminal Impact -->
  <div class="glass-section">
    <h2>Louisiana International Terminal Impact</h2>

    <h3>Current Marketing</h3>
    <p>Port NOLA markets the Louisiana International Terminal (LIT) as a multi-carrier, open-access container terminal in New Orleans East with on-dock rail capability. The stated design envisions access for all Class I carriers through Rail NOLA switching, consistent with Port NOLA's historical neutral-access model. The $1.8 billion project is positioned as a competitive alternative to Gulf of Mexico container terminals at Houston (Barbours Cut/Bayport), Mobile (APM/MDT), and Gulfport, with LIT's on-dock rail providing a speed and cost advantage for inland Midwest distribution.</p>

    <h3>Post-Merger Reality</h3>
    <p>The physical rail approach to LIT runs through the St. Bernard Corridor, which is NS-dominated infrastructure. While Rail NOLA switching theoretically enables multi-carrier access, the practical dominant carrier for LIT's eastern US intermodal traffic would be the merged UP-NS — now with coast-to-coast single-line capability from LIT to every major eastern US market. The marketing promise of competitive access becomes structurally constrained when the carrier controlling the approach infrastructure and the dominant transcontinental intermodal network are the same entity.</p>
    <p>The concern is not that other carriers would be physically excluded — Rail NOLA's neutral mandate would likely prevent outright exclusion. The concern is commercial: a shipping line or cargo owner choosing between LIT and Houston for a Chicago-bound container faces a situation where the price and service offer from the LIT-dominant carrier (UP-NS) has no meaningful competitive counterpart from the alternative carriers (CSX via NOPB interchange), giving UP-NS substantial leverage to capture LIT intermodal rates at levels that would not prevail in a competitive market.</p>

  <!-- Competitive Responses & Industry Opposition -->
  <div class="glass-section">
    <h2>Competitive Responses &amp; Industry Opposition</h2>

    <h3>BNSF-CSX Interline Alliance</h3>
    <p>Within weeks of the UP-NS announcement, BNSF and CSX disclosed a strategic interline cooperation agreement positioned as a competitive response. The alliance would enable single-line pricing across the combined BNSF-CSX network from the Pacific Coast to the Atlantic Seaboard, directly mirroring UP-NS's coast-to-coast capability. Key elements include:</p>
    <ul class="feature-list">
      <li>Unified pricing and service products for BNSF-CSX interline shipments at major gateways (Chicago, Kansas City, Memphis)</li>
      <li>Coordinated car utilization and equipment pooling to reduce transit time on key interline corridors</li>
      <li>Joint marketing of BNSF Pacific ports (Long Beach/LA) + CSX Southeast/Northeast network as an integrated product</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The BNSF-CSX alliance is a direct competitive response to UP-NS rather than a proposed merger — it requires no STB approval and can be implemented commercially. However, analysts note that interline alliances historically underperform single-carrier operations on service consistency and revenue yield, limiting the competitive substitutability of an alliance versus a true merger.</p>

    <h3>CPKC-CSX Myrtlewood Interchange</h3>
    <p>CPKC has proposed a new interchange with CSX at Myrtlewood, Alabama, which would allow CPKC to route Mexican-origin traffic via its KCS Southern mainline into CSX's Southeast network, bypassing the NOLA gateway entirely for many origin-destination pairs. If approved, this interchange would reduce NOLA's role as the dominant Mexico-Southeast interchange point and could divert traffic currently flowing through Rail NOLA to the new CPKC-CSX interchange — a competitive response that simultaneously responds to UP-NS and reduces the merged carrier's strategic importance at NOLA.</p>

    <h3>UP-NS Counter-Argument</h3>
    <p>UP and NS argue that the merger enhances competition by enabling single-line service for thousands of shippers currently forced to use interline (multi-carrier) routing, reducing their effective rate burden and improving service reliability. The carriers point to the 2001 rules' truck-to-rail modal shift requirement as the metric on which they intend to demonstrate competitive enhancement — claiming 1.5 million truckloads shifted from highway to rail under a unified network that can offer cost-competitive single-line service on routes where current interline friction makes rail non-competitive. This argument is strongest in the Midwest-to-Southeast and West-to-East intermodal markets, and weakest at origin-point captive facilities on either network where shipper alternatives disappear regardless of intermodal pricing improvements.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p><strong>The Fundamental Regulatory Question</strong></p>
      <p>The STB's 2001 rules require that UP demonstrate the merger enhances competition — not merely that conditions can be attached to mitigate harm. At the NOLA gateway, the structural problem is that NS and UP serve complementary geographic territories (east and west) with physical interchange at a single point (the Mississippi River crossing). Merging them eliminates the most important competitive interface at the nation's fourth-largest rail gateway. No set of behavioral conditions fully restores what structural competition provides. The STB faces a choice between denying the merger on structural grounds, approving it with conditions that partially mitigate harm, or approving it with structural remedies (divestiture) that effectively re-create independent competition at the gateway. Prior mergers — including UP-SP in 1996 — suggest the STB will seek a middle path of conditions rather than outright denial, but the 2001 "enhance" standard has never been applied and may require a more demanding showing.</p>
